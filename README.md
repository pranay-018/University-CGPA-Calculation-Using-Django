# University-CGPA-Calculation-Using-Django
The CGPA Calculator is a web-based application designed to assist students in calculating their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) efficiently and securely. CGPA is a critical metric that reflects a student's overall academic performance by averaging grade points across multiple subjects. 

This project demonstrates how to build a secure CGPA calculator using Django. Users can register, log in, and input their subject names, CGPA, and credits. The calculator then computes the cumulative GPA and allows the results to be printed in PDF format.

## Features
- User registration and login system for secure access.
- Input fields for subjects, CGPA, and credits.
- CGPA calculation and result generation.
- PDF export functionality for results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x
- ReportLab (for PDF generation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cgpa-calculator.git
